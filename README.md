Project Overview: Personal Portfolio Website

I built a scalable and serverless portfolio website leveraging AWS services. 

The site is deployed via AWS Amplify for seamless updates, with Route 53 handling domain management and SSL certification. 

A Node.js server serves static files, and GitHub is used for version control. 

This setup ensures high availability, reliability, and ease of maintenance while fully utilizing AWS infrastructure.
